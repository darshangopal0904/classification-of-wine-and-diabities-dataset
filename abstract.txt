Machine learning is the area of artificial intelligence that uses logical techniques, so the system gains self-learning ability. It is used to design algorithms based on data trends and historical relationships between data. The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as example, direct experience or instructions, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decision in future, based on the examples we provide. To allow the computers learn automatically is the primary aim. There are three kinds of machine learning supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement machine learning. Supervised machine learning systems provide the learning algorithms with known quantities to support future judgment .In supervised machine learning the training data includes a set of input and corresponding outputs, whereas in un supervised learning the data are classified according to their similarities. In reinforcement learning the activity of the machine has an effect on the environment. Thus machine learning plays a great role in day â€“to-day world, which includes recognition of spam in emails, online customer support, virtual assistants like Google assistants, social media and so on. Machine learning plays a vital role in agriculture. Quality of rice grains is the most significant thing which is to be tested nowadays. Manual methods are always time consuming and also costly. Manual methods are always less accurate. These problems are can be solved by machine learning by implementing computer vision to test the grains. This falls under supervised learning. By implementing methods such as erosion, dilation, edge detection the quality of crops can be assed which gives more accuracy when compared to manual methods.
