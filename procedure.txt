STEPS INVOLVED IN CLASSIFICATION
3.5.1. DATA CLASSIFICATION
STEP 1: Downloading the dataset from online repositories.
STEP 2: Importing the libraries.
STEP 3: Importing the dataset into the program using libraries
STEP 4: Plotting the graph for the assigned values using sklearn library.
STEP 5: Plotting the box plot for all the values using sklearn library.
STEP 6: Initializing X and Y parameters.
STEP 7: Splitting the data as test and train data.
STEP 8: Obtaining the accuracy for each of the three algorithms.
3.5.2. IMAGE CLASSIFICATION
STEP 1: Downloading the dataset from online repositories.
STEP 2: Importing the libraries.
STEP 3: Importing the dataset into the program using libraries
STEP 4: Training the convolution Neural Network.
STEP 5: Testing using a random image and obtaining the output.
